# Code-Refactor
This was the first time I used HTML and CSS in my life.
In this course I mainly foused on chainging the all the non-semantic to semantic elements for accessibility reasons.
I never knew that there were this many different elements in HTML, So I learned about different types about semantic elements in HTML.
At first I was nervous and had some troubles figureing out what I'm suppose to do, but once I research and help from my instrutors it was simpler than I thought.
I had fun with this homework as well.
